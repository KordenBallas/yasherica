# Changelog

All notable changes to the project are recorded here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/): newest first, grouped Added / Changed / Fixed /
Removed, each entry tagged with the affected system and (where useful) requirement ids.

Every functional change appends an entry **in the same change as the code** (CLAUDE.md §8.2).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Character Locomotion:** new subsystem driving movement-based animation and facing
  (`character-locomotion.md`). When the Hero moves it blends idle→run via a `Speed` float and yaws
  to face its travel direction along the shortest arc at a configured rate; idle holds the heading
  (Locomotion R1–R5). Pure `LocomotionSolver` (+ `LocomotionSolverTests`), `CharacterLocomotionView`/
  `CharacterLocomotionPresenter`, `LocomotionConfig` SO, and `CharacterLocomotionInstaller`.
  `CharacterMovementController` now exposes `ICharacterVelocityProvider`; `ModularCharacterVisual`
  exposes the assembled rig's `Animator`. Locomotion attaches to the **existing** `Hero.prefab`
  instance in `Area.unity` (already the cameras' `TrackingTarget` and `AreaSceneEntrypoint.characterTransform`):
  `Tools/Character System/Attach Modular Visual To Hero` adds + wires `ModularCharacterVisual` and
  `CharacterLocomotionView` on `Hero.prefab`, and `Tools/Character System/Setup Locomotion In Open
  Scene` registers `CharacterLocomotionInstaller` (+ `LocomotionConfig`) on the SceneContext. Neither
  creates/deletes/moves a Hero, so the camera follow and entry-platform placement stay intact.
- **Docs:** documentation discipline established — `Docs/` is the maintained source of truth, with a
  mandatory per-system template (`_TEMPLATE.md`) requiring a ScriptableObject Reference and an
  Adding Content section. Added `CHANGELOG.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.

### Changed
- **Character System:** placeholder animation tooling now generates a run clip (`PlaceholderRun.anim`)
  alongside the idle clip and a 1D blend-tree controller on a `Speed` parameter
  (`PlaceholderLocomotion.controller`, idle @ 0 / run @ 1) instead of the single-state idle
  controller. `Speed` defaults to 0, so existing characters still idle (Character System §3.1).
- **AI rules:** rewrote `CLAUDE.md` — fixed section numbering, made the AI workflow planning-first
  (plan + doc-impact statement before code), and made data-driven content extension a first-class
  rule.

### Fixed
- **Character Locomotion:** the run blend is now applied with a controller-only swap
  (`Tools/Character System/Rebuild Locomotion Controller`) that builds the run clip + blend-tree
  controller and assigns it onto the existing rig prefab via a `LoadPrefabContents`/`SaveAsPrefabAsset`
  round-trip, preserving the rig's root-GameObject fileID that `SkeletonDefinition._rigPrefab`
  references. Previously a full regenerate churned those fileIDs, so the skeleton's rig reference
  resolved to null and `ModularCharacterFactory` aborted ("assembly/skeleton/rig prefab is missing").
  `CharacterLocomotionView` now writes `Speed` only when the controller exposes it.
- **Editor tooling:** SceneContext installer registration used `SerializedObject.FindProperty("_installers")`,
  but the field is `_monoInstallers` (`[FormerlySerializedAs("_installers")]`, which `FindProperty`
  ignores) — it returned null and threw. Now registers through the public `Context.Installers` setter
  (`SceneLocomotionSetup`, `PlaceholderCharacterGenerator`).
- **Character System:** placeholder asset generation no longer wipes every definition to a blank
  shell when generation throws midway. `AssetDatabase.SaveAssets()` ran *after* the `try`, so any
  exception skipped it and left `SerializedObject`-configured definitions (parts, slots, sockets,
  skeleton, assembly) empty on disk — which then crashed `PartCatalog` ("empty id") at scene load.
  `SaveAssets`/`Refresh` and the rig cleanup now run in a `finally`.
